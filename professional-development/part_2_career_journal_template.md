## Mod1 Prework Professional Development:

### Part Two: Career Journal

#### Mod0
1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?
    - I have always remained extremely organized to be effective in accomplishing my goals. By carefully planning ahead for deadlines, and managing my time accordingly, I have been able to complete projects within assigned deadlines with minimal difficulty throughout the course of my professional career.
    - Utilizing gSuite (Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Docs) to carefully notate and organize technical resources and notes has allowed me to maintain an easily searchable index to refer back to when encountering a problem, or recalling how to specifically step through a detailed process.
    - I can supplement my digital organization approach by first writing out my notes in pen and paper format, per the recommendations in Mod0 session 1, and then returning to these notes to reflect and reorganize these notes into a digital format, which will make the material more concrete, and retain my ability to digitally search for information quickly.
    - I can supplement my time management skills by providing even more structure in my calendaring, including breaks, to ensure productivity is maintained at the highest level, while also being balanced for time self-care (i.e. exercise)

2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?
    - One of my strengths is quickly learning and adapting to situations, even if they are far outside of my comfort zone. I was able to self-teach and adapt to numerous new roles throughout the tenure of my previous company, with limited training, and no formal education that pertained to many of these roles and responsibilities.
    - These roles included finance & accounting, technical product management for software-defined networks, agile product ownership, and back end Python and API testing via Postman.
    - All of these roles were skills that I had to learn on the fly, with minimal guidance. I was successful with them all, and am confident that I can be successful at Turing as well, as long as I remain organized and apply myself every single day.

3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):
    - I best work in an environment in which I am comfortable, meaning, that I have access to all materials that I feel are necessary to my success.
    - These conditions include enough space for monitors, an area to take paper notes, and good lighting conditions, for me to remain comfortable and focused.
    - I prefer learning in person, but adapted well to fully remote work during the final year of my tenure at my previous job, and am confident that I will be successful while learning in a remote environment.
    - Having time to dedicate to fitness is extremely important to my productivity, which is why I will diligently manage my time, to ensure adequate time to balance my assignments with my personal life and responsibilities.

4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?
    - My greatest area of improvement is building my self confidence. I have been able to self-teach and learn new things very quickly, many of which at my prior company were highly technical in nature.
    - Even though I have seen myself be successful from this perspective, I still struggle to avoid imposter syndrome, and truly believe in myself.
    - To be successful in this program, and beyond, I am going to work on believing in myself more, because the right attitude can greatly improve my trajectory and progress as I continue to learn new skills.

5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
    - Developing a deeper understanding of my strengths will allow me to hone into what has made me successful in the past, thereby allowing me to succeed in learning new languages and skills as a software developer.
    - Aligning with my prior point about building self confidence, by strengthening this skill, I will work to become a stronger developer throughout the back end program, and beyond.
    - I will be setting myself up for success if I ensure a productive work environment, that aligns with my preferences. This will provide positive momentum and minimize distractions as I work to complete the program.

6. Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:
    - I envision Turing allowing me to not only switch career paths to software development, but also open doors to new industries as well. I worked in telecom prior to joining Turing, for almost seven years, and while it is an exciting industry, I am still young and early in my career, and would like to explore additional industries as well.
    - Fitness and outdoor activities (particularly, snowboarding) are among my greatest interests, and with many outdoor apparel and sports companies located nearby (i.e. Spyder), I will hopefully be able to target a developer job with one of these types of companies.
    - I will also be striving to work for large web-scalers (i.e. Google, Facebook), as they now have a local presence, and would be amazing career targets for rapid career growth as a developer.
    - Finally, teaching has always been an interest and passion of mine, as one of my favorite jobs was being a TA for the Business Statistics course at CU Boulder. I imagine that having an opportunity to teach software development would be a very rewarding and fun experience.
