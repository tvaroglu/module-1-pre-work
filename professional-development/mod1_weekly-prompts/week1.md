## Mod 1
### Week 1 Prompts:



1. What would it take for you to build more awareness of your strengths?
    - Active reflection will help build awareness of my strengths. Throughout my career, I have admittedly neglected this practice, which has led to a somewhat vague and nebulous self-understanding of my exact strengths in a practical context.
    - I understand my strengths at a high level, but still have some work to do in honing my ability to succinctly and confidently present my 'elevator pitch'.
2. What would you like to focus on in your professional development at Turing?
    - I would like to focus on building my confidence, refining my elevator pitch, career documentation, and networking skills, so I am well-positioned to find my ideal job following graduation.
3. What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
    - Having confidence to believe in my abilities, and communicating those succinctly as strengths is the biggest challenge that I face.
    - Working through career development exercises individually and with my cohort-mates will help strengthen these abilities.
4. Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
    - At times, I may over-use my technical acumen, and neglect the importance of soft skills. Both aspects are a balanced part of the equation in interviewing, and being highly successful in a team-based collaborative role (assuming the interview is successful, of course!)
    - Refining this balance will take practice, and can be an area of development and coaching from cohort-mates and instructors, as I progress through the program.
5. Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen? Write out action steps you can take to develop awareness of your strengths and any challenges. How could you be aware of the progress you are making?
    - I would like to strengthen my elevator pitch and networking skills while at Turing. My lack of self-confidence is a significant weakness that I will need to strengthen.
    - This weakness can be over-come by:
        1. Actively pushing myself out of my comfort zone, by making myself more vulnerable. I am highly confident from a technical perspective, but not as much from a 'soft skills' perspective.
        2. Practicing my elevator pitch, so I can quickly hone in to my specific strengths, thereby reinforcing my self-confidence.
    - Progress can be tracked by:
        1. Actively seeking feedback from my cohort-mates and instructors.
        2. Utilizing the full spectrum of career-support resources available to me throughout my Turing experience, and diligently taking the time to reflect and record my reflections as I progress through the program.
