## Mod 1
### Week 5 Prompts:



1. Professional Story:
    - On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about sharing your professional story?
        - 4
    - What areas do you feel most confident in when sharing your professional story?
        - I feel confident in sharing my experience and technical strengths, as many are highly relevant to a career in software development (data analytics, agile product development, and project management).
        - I also feel confident sharing the high degree of passion that I have for my work, and how that will ultimately translate to quality code and a rich user experience.
    - What areas do you want to improve on when sharing your professional story?
        - I would like to make the talking points that are leveraged from my professional experience a bit more specific, while also remaining succinct, so my professional story feels highly impactful and captivating.
    - What is working well?
        - Active reflection and practicing communication of my professional story is slowly helping me refine and build my self confidence, which is my most desired area of improvement from a professional development perspective.
        - Having a safe avenue to practice and explore these concepts (within the weekly PD homeroom meetings) has been a valuable exercise.  Beyond personal reflection and practice, hearing others' strategies and feedback is highly valuable.
    - What could be improved?
        - Spending more time and effort actively reflecting and refining these skills will only yield greater rewards.  I recognize the value of these exercises, but still struggle to place them at the forefront of my daily and weekly energy (vs the technical materials).
2. LinkedIn Presence:
    - What is working well?
        - I have a very strong and detailed LinkedIn profile, which accurately reflects my experience and interests.
        - I have a broad network, and often appear within search results, which provides an indication that my profile is strong from an SEO perspective.
    - What could be improved?
        - Updating my summary and tagline could provide more insight into my current status, strengths, and goals.  The last time I truly updated this information was just prior to my departure from my prior company, which still leaves a (small) gap, as I've already built a significant amount of new technical acumen, even just from progressing through mods 0 and 1.
