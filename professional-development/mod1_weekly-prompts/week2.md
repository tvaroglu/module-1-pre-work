### Week 2 Prompts:



1. Have you had your networking call for this week yet?
    - I have had two networking calls this week, one with my mentor, and one with a former colleague (dotted-line superior) from my prior company.
2. If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways?
    - 
3. If you haven’t had the call yet, when are you planning to set it up? Could you use support from this group to send the message to your contact?
    -
4. How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while you’re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?
