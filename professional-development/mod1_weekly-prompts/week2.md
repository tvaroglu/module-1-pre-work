## Mod 1
### Week 2 Prompts:



1. Have you had your networking call for this week yet?
    - I have had two networking calls this week, one with my mentor, and one with a former colleague (dotted-line superior) from my prior company.
    - I was also able to complete a 'cold call' networking activity, during the weekend between weeks 3 and 4.
2. If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways?
    - Discussion with my mentor:
      - Max provided his experience with networking so far, including a template to utilize when engaging new contacts.
      - His approach to networking is 3-pronged: leverage existing contacts outside of Turing, leverage current Turing contacts (particularly instructors), and engage Turing alum directly.
    - Discussion with my former colleague:
      - My former colleague is at a new company, and her husband currently works in a tech startup. Prior to leaving Turing, she had recommended that I look into developer jobs at her husband's company, as they are in a growth phase and will likely require entry-level developer support to scale.
      - I have an excellent relationship with her, and will continue to maintain it, as she has a robust network and would be very happy to help me connect with anyone she can.
    - Cold call discussion:
      - While at a friend's son's first birthday party over Memorial Day weekend, I happened to run into another guest who is a Solution Engineering Manager at Oracle.  I got to hear about some of the new development work that his team is positioning, which has a heavy focus on machine learning and automation.
      - He was interested to hear about my Turing experience so far, and offered to support my job search post-graduation.  I added him on LinkedIn to officially connect and retain his contact information for future reference.
3. How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while youâ€™re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?
    - I feel that I don't quite have my professional portfolio and technical skill-set built out enough to engage cold contacts yet. I am comfortable networking with my current contacts, and will be primarily utilizing this strategy initially, while I work to build out my technical acumen, and ability to showcase it. In full transparency, Mod1 feels a bit early to be cold-calling, as a contact may be in a completely different company and/or industry by the time graduation is approaching.
    - My homeroom group can help support me by providing motivation and guidance through sharing their individual successes and failures in this process, so we can collectively work to sharpen our networking skills together.
    - As my technical acumen and professional development matures, I will begin to put an even heavier focus on networking, especially as Mod3 - Mod4 approaches.
