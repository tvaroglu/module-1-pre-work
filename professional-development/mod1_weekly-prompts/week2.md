### Week 2 Prompts:



1. Have you had your networking call for this week yet?
    - I have had two networking calls this week, one with my mentor, and one with a former colleague (dotted-line superior) from my prior company.
2. If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways?
    - Discussion with my mentor:
      - Max provided his experience with networking so far, including a template to utilize when engaging new contacts.
    - Discussion with my former colleague:
      -
3. How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while youâ€™re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?
