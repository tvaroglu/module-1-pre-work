## Mod 1
### Week 4 Prompts:



1. What have you learned so far about your current network?
    - I have learned that my current network is fairly broad, primarily due to my lengthy tenure and track record of success at my prior company.  I left my prior company on great terms, and have many individuals within my network that would recommend and support me upon request.
    - I have already made new connections while at Turing, and have leveraged every opportunity to expand my network via new contacts.
2. Have you communicated with people you know about your new career in software development? How did you let them know?
    - While leaving my prior company, I reached out to my network over email to let them know about my career transition.  This action provided personal awareness for me as to the current scope of my network, and by copying my personal email into my goodbye announcement, I was able to easily carry forward contact information for my closest contacts within my network.
3. Networking is just another word for building relationships. What are all the ways youâ€™re currently building relationships at Turing? How could you turn to these relationships for support while at Turing? How could you turn to these relationships for support in your job search?
    - Beyond working very closely with my current cohort-mates, I have made new connections through donut chats, and the mixitup groups from weeks 2 and 4.
    - Everyone I've had the pleasure of meeting so far has been more than willing to provide support upon request.  These individuals are now LinkedIn connections within my network, who I will certainly leverage as I officially begin my job search process.
    - In addition to the fantastic message history and accessibility Slack provides to easily contact current Turing students and alum, I will continue to build out my [networking tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_syyUKAMT8Bu1iEhBm5Hb8RMHI_kQxLyQ_GZQu9X3Qg/edit#gid=882531233) as I progress through my Turing experience, to always have a general sense of my current network, and any potential areas of weakness to target for expansion.
