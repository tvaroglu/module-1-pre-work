## Mod 1
### Week 3 Prompts:



1. How is your career story coming along? Are you stuck on any particular part that you would like to discuss? What parts do you feel really good about?
    - I wrote my "personal brand tweet" during the PD course this past Tuesday.
    - While sharing this with my homeroom group, I received positive feedback that the story is crafted around my values.
    - The core focus of my career story being centered around my values is also what I feel really good about. Because the story is crafted around my empathy for others and care for the state of the world, I can leverage that aspect of my story to directly point to the fact that my passion as an aspiring developer stems from my desire to help solve problems that I see in the world around me (vs just pursuing software development as a job).
    - Full (draft) of my personal brand / career story as follows, for future reference and iteration:
        - I am a highly motivated individual that cares deeply about the future state of the world, and those around me.  I have an intense passion to learn and develop new skills, which has led me to pursue a career path in software development, so I can apply my technical and creative strengths towards solving problems that I see in the world around me.  I envision a future of deeply rewarding work that can serve others through direct application of the outputs that I create.
2. Reviewed [guidelines for LinkedIn & personal branding](https://careerdev.turing.edu/resources/branding_resources) as a team, to provide feedback on each other's LinkedIn presences. Actionable items as a result of the review and feedback included:
    [x] Professional headshot for profile picture
    [x] Accurate headline ("Back End Engineering Student..." vs "Student")
    [x] Professional summary to showcase experience and interests (still additional development work to be done as I progress through the program and refine my skills, career/industry interests, etc.)
