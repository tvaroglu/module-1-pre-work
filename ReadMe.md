# Mod1 Prework: Professional Development & Gear Up Assignments

- To organize these related assignments, and to provide an easy way to return to and further modify each Gist within Atom directly, I have grouped these assignments into individual MarkDown files.
- As these will be resources that I will return to throughout the course of my cohort, it made sense to group them into a repository, so changes can be tracked and pushed upstream over time.
